# CasaLingua README

CasaLingua is a multilingual, AI-powered translation and simplification tool that makes complex housing documents more accessible. Developed as an add-on to the Bloom Housing platform, CasaLingua empowers tenants, landlords, and housing navigators with legally accurate, culturally relevant contentâ€”delivered in plain language.

---

## :bulb: Why CasaLingua?
Housing paperwork is often filled with legal jargon, complex policy references, and inconsistencies across jurisdictions. For many people, this creates confusion and barriers to stable housing.

CasaLingua ensures that language is never a reason someone doesnâ€™t understand their rights, responsibilities, or next steps.

---

## ðŸ§° Project Goals
  - Simplify legal and technical housing documents into plain language
  - Translate simplified content into multiple languages with cultural sensitivity
  - Support human-in-the-loop review workflows for accuracy and trust
  - Deploy on low-power hardware or integrate into large-scale housing systems like Bloom

## :gear: Key Capabilities
- **Multimodal Input Support**: Accepts PDFs, DOCX, audio, text, and image-based documents (OCR)
- **Language Detection**: Auto-detects input language to route throught appropriate pipelines
- **Legal Text Simplification**: Converts complex clauses into plain languageâ€”tailored by jurisdiction and reading level
- **Multilingual Translation**: Translates content with cultural and regional accuracy using LLMs fine-tuned on housing domains
